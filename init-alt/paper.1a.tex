% ABSTRACT

\begin{comment}
Selective pressure can favor a gene for altruistic behavior even in a
community of takers who give nothing back, even when the behavior
results in the giver having no offspring, even when there is no
mechanism to detect or punish takers who give nothing back, and even
when givers must compete with their own beneficiaries for the
resources needed for giving. Three conditions suffice to produce this
selective pressure: (1) the gene encodes only a probability of
engaging in the giving behavior; (2) benefits from the behavior
decrease with distance from the giver; and (3) the total benefit to
the giver's neighbors exceeds the cost to the giver. A population
under these conditions tends to contain a stable range of variation in
alleles that code for different probabilities of the giving behavior,
in some cases producing castes centered at different probabilities. In
effect, alleles for varying degrees of giving produce partial clones
who are partially sterile in proportion to their giving. Such alleles
represent a continuum between the sterile castes of social insects, or
somatic cells in multicellular organisms (100\% clones, 100\% givers,
100\% sterile), and organisms that try to maximize inclusive fitness
entirely through their own offspring. The selective pressure favoring
partial givers provides a genetic explanation for some forms of group
selection, and predicts as-yet-unexplored correlations between
communal giving and sterility.

The total attempted absorption $T$ at each location is:

$$
T_{x,y}(t) = \sum\limits_{o \in O(t)} \kern-4pt A(x - o_x, y - o_y)
$$

\noindent
where $O(t)$ is all organisms alive at time $t$ and $A(\Delta x, \Delta y)$
is the attempted absorption relative to an organism's location.

The actual amount $o_A$ absorbed by an organism is:

$$
o_A(t) = \sum\limits_{x,y} \begin{cases}
A(x - o_x, y - o_y)  &  \mbox{if }T_{x,y}(t) \leq 1  \\
\noalign{\vskip 0.5em}
\dfrac{A(x - o_x, y - o_y)}{T_{x,y}(t)}  & \mbox{if }T_{x,y}(t) > 1
\end{cases}
$$
