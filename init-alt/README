init-alt: A small research project to see if genes for community-benefiting
behavior can evolve in a population consisting entirely of "takers" if the
benefits decrease with distance from each "giver" and the gene encodes only a
probability of "giving". In effect, such a gene encodes a probability of
becoming a worker bee or mitotic cell. Such a probability is one way to
implement organisms that are partially clones, partially sterile, and
partially altruistic, as opposed to 100% sterile, 100% cloned, 100% altruistic
mitotic cells.

The simulation works as follows:

- The organisms live in a 2D world of finite granularity. Each organism
  occupies one pixel in the world.

- Each generation, resources are deposited equally at all pixels in the world,
  analogous to sunlight. Each organism absorbs all nutrients within an
  "absorption radius" minus a certain percentage (say, 90%) that is lost to
  predation (say, animals eating the organisms' leaves). All organisms have
  the same absorption radius. Where two or more organisms' absorption zones
  overlap, they divide the available resources equally among them.

- Organisms have one gene: a probability of "giving". An organism that "gives"
  converts all its incoming resources into a "protection zone" around it. In
  the protection zone, all predation is reduced by some percentage that's
  proportional to the amount of resources absorbed by the giver. The giver
  gains no benefit from the protection it provides; that only affects other
  organisms in its protection zone.

- Each generation, all organisms die, and the "takers" produce a number of
  offspring proportional to the amount of resources they absorbed. The
  offspring are distributed randomly around the parent organism, with closer
  distances being more probable. "Givers" produce no offspring.

- Mutation consists of adding or subtracting a small amount to the probability
  of "giving".

- In the first generation, all organisms are 100% "takers".
