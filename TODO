* Increase the radius of giving in Mb. Does that tend to make the noncarriers prevail in
  a world without mutation?
  Or, stated the other way, does a small radius of giving (which is implicit kin selection)
  create some stability for carriers?
  We'll need:
  - switch to indicate number of carriers at the start.
  - switch to replace continuously variable g with carrier on/off
DONE: Result is mutation with kinship selection makes the altruistic gene
prevail, with a few freeloaders continuing to exist. Removing kinship selection
causes the altruistic gene to go extinct.
