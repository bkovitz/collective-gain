Apply RadialDecayTable to World to determine amount of sunlight available
at each cell.

Apply RadialDecayTable to World to determine attempted absorption.

Distribute sunlight to each taker.

Takers reproduce, via Poisson process. Place each new organism with its own
g in cells via RadialDecayTable.

In cells that have more than one organism, randomly choose one for the next
generation.
